# Getting Started

## Overview

`Rattail` is a utilities library for front-end developers, `lightweight` and `ts-friendly`.

### Installation

::: code-group

```shell [npm]
npm i rattail -S
```

```shell [yarn]
yarn add rattail
```

```shell [pnpm]
pnpm add rattail
```

:::

### Usage

```ts
import { isString } from 'rattail'

console.log(isString('rattail'))
```

### Why not Lodash?

`Rattail` is not a replacement for [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) nor a functional programming solution. Rattail aims to provide practical tools for more application scenarios.
